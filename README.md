Basic Blackjack Rules from (http://www.hitorstand.net/strategy.php):

The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.
Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand.
Each player starts with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden until the end.
To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn.
If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.
If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace & 10), you got a blackjack.
Blackjack means you win 1.5 the amount of your bet.
Dealer will hit until it's cards total 17 or higher.
This version of blackjack does not include splitting, doubling or 5-card tricks.

Specific rules for the game:
